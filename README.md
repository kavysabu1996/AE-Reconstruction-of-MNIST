# AE-Reconstruction-of-MNIST

The MNIST dataset is a popular datast of handwritten digits. It includes 60,000 samples for training machine learning models, and 10,000 samples for evaluating and testing the performance of these models.

I've trained a AutoEncoder model to generate handwritten digits.

### Requirements
- numpy, TensorFlow and matplotlib

mnist has 10000 test samples. So you can select any index_number varying from 0 to 9999

```
python3 run.py --idx index_number
```

```
python3 run.py --idx 993
```
